## download was started from, also known as referer.
## $VIMB_DOWNLOAD_PATH Setting value of download-path which would be used

## && curl -sLJOC - -e '$VIMB_URI' %s"
# set download-command (string)

## it, disabling it again when no longer needed.

## Comma separated list of headers that replaces default header sent by WebKit
## or new headers. The format for the header list elements is name[=[value]].
## Note that these headers will replace already existing headers. If there is
## no = after the header name, then the complete header will be removed from
## the request, if the = is present means that the header value is set to
## empty value.
##
## To use = within a header value the value must be quoted like shown in
## Example for the Cookie header.
##
## Example: :set header=DNT=1,User-Agent,Cookie='name=value' Send the 
## ‘Do Not Track’ header with each request and remove the User-Agent Header
## completely from request.

## as asdfg;lkjh, each hint is ‘numbered’ based on the characters of the home
## row. Note that the hint matching by label built of hint-keys is case 
## sen‐ sitive. In this vimb differs from some other browsers that show hint
## labels in upper case, but match them lowercase. To have upper case hint
## labels, it’s possible to add following css to the ‘style.css’ file in 
## vimb’s configuration directory.
## ._hintLabel {text-transform: uppercase !important;}
set hint-keys=asdfghjkl

## If this is set to ‘true’ typed chars that are not part of the set
